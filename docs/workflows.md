# Workflows

## Annotation Workflows

### [AnnotateAF](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/kj_project_gnomad_lr/wdl/AnnotateAF.wdl)
This workflow leverages [AnnotateVcf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/main/wdl/AnnotateVcf.wdl) from the GATK-SV pipeline in order to annotate internal allele frequencies based on sample sexes and ancestries. It runs on all variants in the input VCF, including SVs.

Inputs:
- `File vcf`: VCF to annotate.
- `File vcf`: Index for VCF to annotate.
- `Array[String] contigs`: Contigs to annotate within the input VCF.
- `File sample_pop_assignments`: Two column file containing sample IDs in the first column and ancestry labels in the second column.
- `File ped_file`: Six column file containing the cohort pedigree, with specifications described in [this article](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531972-PED-Pedigree-format).
- `File lps_tsv`: LPS TSV file output by the [`trgt-lps` tool](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt-lps), which contains information regarding the longest polymer sequence within each sample for each loci genotyped by TRGT.
- `Array[String]? strip_info_fields`: Comma-separated list of `INFO` fields to remove from the input VCF prior to annotation.
- `Int records_per_shard`: Number of variants to keep within a single shard during annotation.
- `File par_bed`: From [references](references.md).

Outputs:
- `af_annotated_vcf`: Annotated VCF.
- `af_annotated_vcf_idx`: Index for annotated VCF.


### [AnnotateAgeMetrics](../wdl/annotation/AnnotateAgeMetrics.wdl)
This workflow computes the age distribution of carriers for every variant in the input VCF. For each sample it derives an age from a date-of-birth table relative to a fixed reference date, then tabulates the number of heterozygous and homozygous carriers of each allele that fall into a set of user-defined age bins, along with overflow `smaller` and `larger` bins for ages outside the configured range. It emits a TSV of these per-allele age-bin counts.

Inputs:
- `File vcf`: VCF to annotate.
- `File vcf_idx`: Index for VCF to annotate.
- `Array[String] contigs`: Contigs to annotate within the input VCF.
- `File age_data`: CSV file with `person_id` and `date_of_birth` columns, used to derive each sample's age.
- `Array[Int] age_bins`: Age-bin edges, in years, into which carrier ages are binned.

- `Int? records_per_shard`: Number of variants to keep within a single shard during annotation.

Outputs:
- `annotations_tsv_age`: TSV of per-allele carrier counts across the age bins.


### [AnnotateCallsetOverlap](../wdl/annotation/AnnotateCallsetOverlap.wdl)
This workflow ingests an evaluation VCF and two truth VCFs — one of SNVs & indels and one of SVs — and finds matching variants across them in order to compare the AF & VEP annotations of the matched pairs. This serves as a degree of benchmarking, as it ensures that annotations applied to a larger cohort (e.g. gnomAD) are in line with those we annotate. It also enables the identification of variants that are outliers relative to existing cohorts by pulling out those with a large amount of discordance in their annotation across the callsets.

The workflow undergoes multiple rounds of variant matching in order to determine matched pairs:
1. Exact match across CHROM, POS, REF and ALT.
2. Truvari match with overlap percentages of 90%, 70% and 50%.
3. Matching based on `bedtools closest`, finetuned for SVs. Here the evaluation and truth variants are split by type and converted to a symbolic representation, after which separate `bedtools closest` passes are run — one tuned for deletions and duplications via reciprocal positional overlap, and one tuned for insertions via breakpoint proximity — so that each evaluation variant is paired with the nearest same-type truth variant above the per-callset minimum SV-length thresholds.

> **Note:** When converting to symbolic representation, only canonical DUPs (allele_type = `DUP` exactly) are treated as DUP; other DUP subtypes (e.g., `dup_interspersed`, `inv_dup`) are treated as insertions.

This workflow annotates each variant with its GA4GH Variant Representation Specification (VRS) attributes using a seqrepo sequence repository.

### [PlotPhasingResults](../wdl/annotation_utils/PlotPhasingResults.wdl)
This utility evaluates backbone-phasing accuracy by comparing backbone-phased VCFs against base (truth) VCFs.

### [PostProcess](../wdl/annotation_utils/PostProcess.wdl)
This utility bundles every genotype-update and post-processing step applied to a near-final callset into one workflow, with a required `run_` Boolean guarding each step so that the input VCF is left untouched when all are set to `false`. The per-record steps are applied in a single pass over the VCF: each variant is first matched against `transfer_vcf` and has its genotypes transferred (when `run_transfer_genotypes` is set) using its unmodified properties, after which the remaining steps — unphasing, ploidy normalization, TR-ID decrementing, MEI pruning, homopolymer flagging, singleton filtering and same-coordinate sorting — run in order. Some steps require an accompanying field — `run_transfer_genotypes` needs `transfer_vcf`, `run_unphase_samples` needs `unphase_samples`, and `run_normalize_ploidy` needs `ped`. The per-record pass can optionally be region-sharded via `shard_bin_size`.

This workflow adapts the GATK-SV annotation QC pipeline in order to produce a quality-control report for an annotated callset. It collects VCF-wide site-level statistics per contig, converts the VCF to BED, plots the aggregated site metrics and — when comparison datasets are supplied — benchmarks the callset against them at the site level.

### [ResolveHaplotypeOverlaps](../wdl/annotation_utils/ResolveHaplotypeOverlaps.wdl)
This utility detects and resolves haplotype-level overlaps among non-TR, non-TR-enveloped variants in a phased cohort VCF. For each sample, it extracts the sample's non-ref calls (excluding `allele_type="trv"` and `INFO/TR_ENVELOPED` variants), then sweeps each haplotype's variant intervals to find all overlapping pairs. Overlapping pairs are resolved by keeping the variant that spans more reference sequence (larger `len(REF)`) — which always favors DELs over INS or SNVs. When two variants span the same reference length, the higher-GQ call wins; remaining ties are broken by `INFO/allele_length`, then type rank (DEL > INS > SNV), then QUAL, then input-file order. The loser's FORMAT fields (`GT`, `GQ`, `DP`, `EV`, `BEV`, `AD`, `PL`) are cleared in the output VCF. The workflow scatters per-sample detection across all samples, then applies the collected clears contig-by-contig (with optional record-count sharding) to produce the resolved VCF.

### [TransformINSToDUP](../wdl/annotation_utils/TransformINSToDUP.wdl)
This utility converts insertion variants with `allele_type=dup` into symbolic DUP records where the insertion's duplication source (from `INFO/ORIGIN`) passes two criteria: size similarity between the insertion length and the ORIGIN region length must meet the `dup_size_similarity` threshold, and the insertion POS must fall within the ORIGIN region or within `dup_breakpoint_window` bases of its breakpoints. Passing records have their POS set to the ORIGIN start, REF set to `N`, ALT set to `<DUP>`, and `allele_length` updated to the ORIGIN region length. Variants with multiple comma-separated `ORIGIN` values are skipped and passed through unchanged, as a single unambiguous source region is required for the transformation.
