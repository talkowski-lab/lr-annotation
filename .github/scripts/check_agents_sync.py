"""Check that .claude/CLAUDE.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md stay in sync with AGENTS.md.

Both files are expected to be symlinks to ../AGENTS.md, but this checks byte-for-byte
content equality rather than symlink-ness, so it also catches the case where a tool
(e.g. GitHub's web editor, a symlink-unaware checkout) replaces the symlink with a
materialized file whose content has drifted from AGENTS.md.
